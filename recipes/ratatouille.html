            <p>Ratatouille was a dish crafted by poor provincial French peasantry as a way to transform simple vegetables into a hearty and delicious meal without meat. It may look like it takes a long time to make, but it’s actually quite simple.</p>

        <h4 class="section heading">Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin preparing the tomato-pepper sauce by preheating your oven to 450° F.</li>
            <li>Place the pepper halves face down on a baking tray lined with aluminum foil and roast for 15 minutes or until the skin loosens from the peppers. Remove from the oven and let cool.</li>
            <li>Peel and finely dice the pepper halves.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a medium-sized skillet and sauté the garlic and onions for 8 minutes or until soft and translucent. Be careful not to brown the garlic and onions.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes and tomato juice with the fresh herbs and let simmer over low heat until the tomatoes become soft and most of the juice has cooked away. This should take roughly 10 minutes but watch it carefully to prevent it from browning.</li>
            <li>Add the finely diced roasted pepper to the sauce and let simmer until soft.</li>
            <li>Season with salt to taste and strain out the herbs using a fork.</li>
            <li>Allow the oven to drop down to 275° F.</li>
            <li>Spread the sauce you just made across the bottom of an 8 inch baking dish or cassolette.</li>
            <li>Starting from the edge of the dish, tightly arrange the sliced fresh vegetables on top of the sauce. Your vegetables should overlap with about ¼ inch of each slice exposed to the eye. As you approach the center, overlap the vegetables in a tight spiral so that the vegetables create a mound in the center. Continue until the entire dish is full or you run out of vegetables.</li>
            <li>Combine the remaining garlic, thyme, and oil in a small bowl and season the mixture with salt and black pepper to taste. Spread the mixture over the vegetables and seal the dish with aluminum foil. Bake for roughly 2 hours before testing the vegetables with a paring knife. Leave the dish uncovered and bake for another 30 minutes to achieve a golden-brown top.</li>
            <li>To make the vinaigrette, whisk the oil, thyme, salt, pepper, and vinegar into an emulsion.</li>
            <li>To serve, slice the ratatouille into quarters and carefully lift it from the baking dish with a spatula. Fan the vegetables out by twisting the spatula a full 90° and finish it off with a drizzle of the vinaigrette.</li>
